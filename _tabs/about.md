Hi, my name is Jacob.  
I have been working as a security engineer since November 2021. Before that, I had been in systems and network administration since 2017.
In every position I've held, I consistently adopt a security-centric approach to tasks, proactively mitigating information security risks before they materialize.
My adeptness at scripting enables me to streamline processes through automation, enhancing efficiency and reliability.
I possess a deep-seated passion for continuous learning, cybersecurity, problem-solving, and supporting others in achieving their goals.

For 2024, my goals are to acquire several offensive security certifications and continue down the offsec rabbithole:
- [x] OSCP - 1/18
- [x] CRTP - 3/19
- [x] CRTE - 5/13
- [x] CRTO - 6/29
- [x] OSEP - 10/24

Needless to say, it's been a busy year!
