Welcome to my GitHub Pages site!  
Here, I will be posting tech tips, code, my CTF writeups, and various tech ramblings.  
Some of the initial CTF writeups may be a little rough around the edges.
I'm going in mostly chronological order from when I first started doing CTFs and my note taking wasn't as detailed back then as it is now so I am making the best of my notes from the early days.

That being said, buckle up and enjoy the ride!
