Hi, my name is Jacob.  
I've been working as a security engineer since November 2021. Before that, I had been in systems and network administration since 2017.  
In any role I've been in, I've always found opportunities to approach objectives with a security-centric mindset which has helped mitigate information security risks before they became a reality. Additionally, I enjoy finding opportunities to utilize my scripting skills to automate the completion of tasks.  
I have a passion for learning, cybersecurity, finding solutions, and helping others.  

For 2024, my goals are to acquire several offensive security certifications and continue down the offsec rabbithole:
- [x] OSCP - 1/18
- [x] CRTP - 3/19
- [x] CRTE - 5/13
- [ ] CRTO
- [ ] OSEP
